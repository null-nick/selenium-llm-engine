This repository provides a standalone, Docker-friendly Selenium-powered LLM engine proxy. It automates browser access to Web GPTs via Selenium to expose a simple OpenAI-compatible API and web admin UI.

Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements, new engines, or engine definitions (`engines/*.json` or `engines/*.py`).

> [!NOTE]
> The application listens on port `8000` by default. Docker Compose maps this to `14848` in this repository, but you can change this mapping freely in `docker-compose.yml`.


## Features

- Selenium-based support web based LLM.
- Unified REST API endpoints:

## Quickstart

The easiest way to run Selenium LLM Engine is to pull the Docker image from Docker Hub.

1. Pull image and run with Docker:

```bash
docker pull xargonwan/selenium-llm-engine:latest

docker run -d --name selenium-llm-engine \
  -p 14848:8000 \
  -p 3001:3000 \
  -v data:/app/data \
  -v config:/config \
  xargonwan/selenium-llm-engine:latest
```

2. Verify service is running:

- `http://localhost:14848/api/ping`
- `http://localhost:14848/models`

> [!NOTE]
> Model discovery is dynamic. Although examples use `chatgpt`, `gemini`, `stepfun`, `claude`, the available engines are those present in `engines/` and reported by `/models`.

3. OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

- `http://localhost:14848/chatgpt/prompt`
- `http://localhost:14848/gemini/prompt`
- `http://localhost:14848/stepfun/prompt`
- `http://localhost:14848/claude/prompt`
- `http://localhost:14848/v1/chat/completions`
- `http://localhost:14848/ui`

4. OpenAPI / OpenAI client

This application exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint for clients and SDKs:

- Endpoint: `POST http://localhost:14848/v1/chat/completions`
- `model`: `chatgpt` or `gemini`
- `messages`: standard OpenAI array

Example using `openai` (Python):

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="dummy")  # the proxy does not require a real key, values can be dummy
client.api_base = "http://localhost:14848"
client.api_type = "openai"
client.api_version = ""

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="chatgpt",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short poem in English about a robot learning to sing."}]
)
print(resp)
```

If the client does not directly support base URL configuration, use a manual request with `requests`:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:14848/v1/chat/completions"

payload = {
    "model": "chatgpt",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Scrivi una breve poesia in italiano."}]
}

r = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print(r.json())
```

## Media upload support

`/v1/chat/completions` (and legacy per-engine `/chatgpt/prompt`, `/gemini/prompt`, etc.) accepts multimodal `messages` payloads where a message `content` can be an array of parts:

- `type: "text"` for text content
- `type: "image_url"` for an inline image using a data URI or raw base64 payload
- `type: "input_audio"` for audio upload in supported engines

Example `curl` request with an inline image:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:14848/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "chatgpt",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {"type": "text", "content": "Here is an image:"},
          {
            "type": "image_url",
            "url": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR4nGNgYAAAAAMAAWgmWQ0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=",
            "filename": "example.png"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

If the chosen engine supports audio uploads, use `type: "input_audio"` with a base64 audio payload and optional `mime_type`:

```json
{
  "type": "input_audio",
  "data": "<base64-audio-data>",
  "mime_type": "audio/mpeg",
  "filename": "example.mp3"
}
```

3. Prompt example (API call)

Before sending a prompt, make sure you have logged in using `/login/chatgpt` or `/login/gemini`.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:14848/chatgpt/prompt" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Write a short poem in English about a robot learning to sing."}'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": "llm_1680390000",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1680390000,
  "model": "chatgpt",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."},
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 0},
  "engine": "chatgpt",
  "prompt": "Write a short poem...",
  "elapsed_ms": 850
}
```

4. Login flow (before `/prompt`):

- `POST http://localhost:14848/login/chatgpt`
- `POST http://localhost:14848/login/gemini`

## Local build (from source)

If you want to build locally from this repository, use Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XargonWan/selenium-llm-engine.git
cd selenium-llm-engine
docker compose up --build
```

This runs the same service under `http://localhost:14848` (and `http://localhost:3006` for webtop).

## Production deploy (nginx + SSL)

A ready-to-use production stack with self-signed SSL is provided in `deploy/`:

```bash
# Default (CN=localhost)
./deploy/start.sh

# Custom hostname / IP
./deploy/start.sh 192.168.0.100
```

This creates:
- **nginx** reverse proxy with SSL on ports `443` / `80`
- **selenium-llm-engine** with API on port `14848` (direct) and webtop exposed only to nginx
- Self-signed certificate generated automatically in `deploy/certs/`
- Local bind-mount volumes in `deploy/data/` and `deploy/config/`

Access points:
- `https://<host>` — Web UI (via nginx, HTTPS)
- `http://<host>:14848` — API (direct, no SSL)

To stop: `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml down`


## Notes

- Requires Chromium + chromedriver and undetected-chromedriver.
- Container binds persistent profile path: `/config/.config/chromium-synth`.
- If using Python locally, a compatible FastAPI/Pydantic stack is required, but this approach is not tested nor supported.

## Development

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

## Directory structure

- `app.py` - FastAPI entrypoint
- `core/` - Selenium engine wrappers and manager
- `db/` - SQLite persistence helpers
- `deploy/` - Production deploy (nginx + SSL + docker-compose)
- `web/` - minimal static UI
- `tests/` - API tests and `stress_test.py` (manual, excluded from CI)
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` - container setup

## Stress Test Results

A ramp-up stress test was run against the live system with the following setup:
- 10 long prompts (~3,000–8,000 chars each) sent to Gemini with delays ramping from 30s down to 0s
- 10 long prompts sent to ChatGPT (same ramp-up pattern)
- 5 prompts each sent in burst to: claude, copilot, perplexity, stepfun, grok

### Average Response Times

| Engine | Avg Response | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| copilot | 16.9s | Fastest, but unstable under load |
| perplexity | 35.2s | Moderately stable |
| chatgpt (unlogged) | 71.1s | Slow, high variance (42–426s) |
| claude (unlogged) | 79.0s | Error-prone in unlogged mode |
| gemini | 94.8s | Slowest but most reliable |

### System Soliditude

- **FIFO queue**: No race conditions detected; requests to each engine are processed sequentially and correctly.
- **Per-engine parallelism**: Each engine processes independently; no cross-engine interference.
- **Failure modes**: The dominant failure cause is `fill_input` verification rejecting long prompts that the target site reformats (e.g., ChatGPT truncating or reformatting prompt text before sending). A secondary issue is a `Connection pool is full` warning indicating a single-connection pool to the Chrome driver, which creates a bottleneck during burst traffic.
- **Engines requiring login**: stepfun, grok, and (partially) claude are unreliable or non-functional without authenticated sessions.

### Overall Assessment

The system handles concurrent load across multiple engines without deadlocks or queue corruption. The FIFO queue is the strongest component. Browser stability under sustained burst traffic is the main fragility — driven by input verification strictness and connection pool limitations rather than the queue itself.
